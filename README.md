# MLB-Scout-Database
A starter database I created for school, uses mainly SQL. The idea was to create another way for scouts to access player data and make it more efficient. The project was open-ended, meaning we as students had free rein to create a database that also had a real-world application. The SQL Query is commented out, so you can run it, change it around, and create new statements.
